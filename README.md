# Code for Earth: Uniting Tech & Nature on Earth Day

As Earth Day approaches, I'm filled with a renewed sense of inspiration and purpose. Our planet's largest civic event is not just a day on the calendar; it's a powerful reminder of our collective responsibility to protect and cherish the incredible natural world we call home. 

I'm thrilled to be part of this Frontend Challenge, where we're not only showcasing our technical skills but also celebrating the beauty and importance of Earth Day. Bringing back the CSS Art and Glam Up My Markup prompts adds a creative twist, allowing us to merge our passion for frontend development with our love for the planet. With the added prize category dedicated to Earth Day, there's even more motivation to craft something truly special â€“ something that not only dazzles the eyes but also speaks to the heart.

I can't wait to see the amazing entries that emerge from this challenge, each one a testament to our commitment to making a positive impact on our planet. Let's code with purpose, creativity, and a deep reverence for the Earth we all share.
